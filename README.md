# Cryptocurrencies

# Overview 
A report that includes what cryptocurrencies are on the trading market and how they could be grouped to create a classification system for a new investment by Accountability Accounting was produced using the principals of unsupervised machine learning models to analyze how to process data, how to cluster, how to reduce dimensions, and how to reduce the principal components using PCA.

There were four deliverables for this project. Examples of the output from each deliverable is included below. 

1: Preprocessing the Data for PCA (which cryptocurrencies are trading on the market)
